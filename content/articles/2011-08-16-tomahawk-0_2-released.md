> First to PlanetKDE readers: Tomahawk is not directly a KDE project, in that it is hosted on the KDE infrastructure. We do however use Phonon and have been working with Phonon developers to improve the state of our Phonon backends to get a truly hassle-free cross-platform audio framework. A positive outcome of the renewed development interest in Phonon has let us deploy Phonon-Vlc on all 3 linux/mac/windows platforms with absolutely no problems—not a mean feat. Anyway, back to the story.


We’re happy to announce the release of Tomahawk 0.2, the second major release of our fledgling social media player. It’s been a fast two and a half months since 0.1 was released, and we’ve put a lot of work into backend stability as well as UI polishing. Some of the main new features we added include a revamped Dashboard, showing recently added track and albums from across your network as well as recently played tracks from your friends, as well as a “Listen Along” feature that lets you immediately “latch on” to what one of your friends is listening to (resolving to your own sources of the tracks). It’s hard to run out of things to listen to when you can hitch a ride with your friends… On top of all of those we have new specific album and artist pages, the ability to love tracks and view the tracks that your friends have loved, search globally across all your network and resolvers, and the ability to parse rdio and Spotify links for data liberation :) This is of course only the tip of the iceberg, so I’ll stop myself from just repeating the contents of our very extensive [Changelog](https://raw.github.com/tomahawk-player/tomahawk/master/ChangeLog) and let you go and see it yourself. (And [come hack with us](https://github.com/tomahawk-player/tomahawk) in #tomahawk!)

If you by any chance still haven’t had a chance to check out what Tomahawk is and why it’s a media player worth checking out, we helpfully have a quick intro video to show it on our [that will get you sorted out.](http://www.gettomahawk.com/)

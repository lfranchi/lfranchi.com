# My website

This is the git repo for the (upcoming new) http://lfranchi.com

It uses nanoc for the static site generation, with some snipped culled from various nanoc3 sites around the web. Feel free to read and take inspiration from!

The site also uses haml for markdown, and compass/sass for styling.
